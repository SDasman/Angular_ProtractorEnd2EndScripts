# AngularJS Automated Testing Tool: Protractor
Note: Can work on non AngularJS website by just disabling that feature.

## This repo contains multiple use cases of common Automated Test Cases.

### Some require some tweaking or page specific paths. Others can be run on any website.

Set up a local HTML/JS Website or use a Acquia VM to mock a Drupal Site - Either way Test On and leave me any hints/comments/ideas as comments.
